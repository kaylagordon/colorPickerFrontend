### ABOUT
This app was built to help people increase their math fluency in three areas: simplifying, factoring, and deriving. Users can choose their topic of study and the time they would like to spend practicing. During the round, users will answer questions. If the answer is correct, a new card will appear. If the answer is incorrect, the user can change their answer. After the round is played, users will see their stats.

The problem sets are created using methods that generate random numbers and problem structures. Fetch calls are made to the [Newton API](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api) to check user answers. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project has a robust testing suite.
